# Homework 10 

Building my very own package called `rsalad`.

The package is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/daattali/rsalad) and all
its documentation is there.  See the vignette
[here] (https://github.com/daattali/rsalad/blob/master/inst/doc/overview.md).


Note: please ignore the `spinMyR` file/function when marking. It's an extra function that I want to include in my package but it's complex and doesn't have any testing or documentation yet, so just don't look at it :)
