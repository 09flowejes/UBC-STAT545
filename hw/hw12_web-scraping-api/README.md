# Homework 12  

How to scrape the web using R and use APIs to access information.  I looked to
see if there is a relationship between the amount of money a country spends
on R&D and the number of Nobel laureates they produce.

### Code
[The R code](./hw12_web-scraping-api.R) was
used to generate the Rmarkdown, markdown, and HTML documents.  

> Note: that I didn't write a Rmarkdown manually, the R script generated all of 
them `rsalad::spinMyR`. `rsalad` is a package I wrote that is available on 
GitHub and can be installed with `devtools::install_github("daattali/rsalad").
The command to generate all the files was
`rsalad::spinMyR("hw12_web-scraping-api.R", wd = "hw/hw12_web-scraping-api")`
with the working directory being the root directory of this repository.

### Report
