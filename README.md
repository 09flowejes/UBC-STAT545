# Dean Attali's STAT 545 work
STAT545 is a course at the University of British Columbia, taught by [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/jennybryan).  
This repository contains all my coursework from UBC STAT 545, as well as many other little projects I developed during the schoolyear.  I was also a TA for the course in its 2014 offering.   
This repository can serve as a sampler with many references showing how to perform useful stuff in R.

### Directory structure
- [`data`](./data) - data files
- [`hw`](./hw) - homework submissions for 2014 course
- [`hw-noob`](./hw-noob) - homework submissions for 2013 course, when I was a complete R noob
- [`reference`](./reference) - various tutorials/references/R scripts that can be useful in many future projects  
- [`shiny-apps`](./shiny-apps) - Shiny applications that I built
- [`terrorism-project`](./terrorism-project) - final project from 2013 course, very interesting analysis of global terrorism activity over time
