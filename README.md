# Dean Attali's STAT 545 work
This repository contains all my coursework from UBC STAT 545.  
At this time (2014-10-25) I am a second year UBC graduate student in Bioinformatics, working in Martin Hirst's epigenomics lab.  I took the first half of this course in 2013 as my first ever introduction to R, and completed the second half of the course in its 2014 offering.  
This repository can serve as a sampler with many references showing how to perform basic useful stuff in R.

### Directory structure
- [`data`](./data) - data files
- [`hw`](./hw) - homework submissions for 2014 course
- [`hw-noob`](./hw-noob) - homework submissions for 2013 course, when I was a complete R noob
- [`reference`](./reference) - various tutorials/references/R scripts that can be useful in many future projects
- [`terrorism-project`](./terrorism-project) - final project from 2013 course, very interesting analysis of global terrorism activity over time

### Useful/interesting files
